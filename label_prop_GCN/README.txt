The code in this directory corresponds to our label propagated GCN model:
** 'preprocess_data.py' corresponds to preprocess data and generate the adjacent matrix, we put the generated matrix to data directory
** 'main.ipynb' this is the main code for our model, since we need GPU for training GCN, this code is designed for google colabotory, it will load data from data driectory
